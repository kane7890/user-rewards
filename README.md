* Change the "SPEND 20 POINTS" button on the user page to just be a string that says " YOU HAVE A FREE PURCHASE"

* In a new purchase form, conditionally render a checkbox when the user DOES have 20 points that says "use points?". In the controller, if the checkbox is checked, reset the user's point count AND give them a purchase.
